I am doing Ph.D. at [Gollisano College of Computing and Information Science](https://www.rit.edu/computing/), located at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/). Currenly, I am working in Networked Sensing Systems Lab under the guidance of [Prof. Fawad Ahmed](https://fawadahm.github.io/). My research focuses on developing systems for improving performance and safety of self-driving cars. 
 
Before Joining RIT, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Lahore University of Management Science (LUMS)](https://sbasse.lums.edu.pk/). During my research here, I concentrated on using satellite data together with deep learning to develop a data-driven approach for the creation of sustainable urban communities. Prior to this, I was a Research Assistant at the [Information Technology University](https://itu.edu.pk/), where I worked on 3D computer vision. My research aimed to improve the robustness of Structure From Motion by substituting traditional modules in the pipeline with deep learning modules. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Engineering and Technology Lahore](https://www.uet.edu.pk/), and my academic achievements earned me a place on the dean's honor list.
